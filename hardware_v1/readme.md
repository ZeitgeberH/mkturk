The basic mkturk hardware setup requires an electronics board that receives a trigger from the tablet and dispenses a reward. In mkturk_v1, this was accomplished using either an audio (trigger from sound jack) or a photo (tigger photodiode by white bar on screen) trigger to an arduino micro which then gated open a 5V signal to drive a low power pump.

See the schematic and associated parts list in this folder for constructing a similar circuit.
